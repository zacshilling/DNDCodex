            <h3>General Information</h3>

            <p>Firstly, the User must be aware of the Improbable Stair to access the Improbable Stair.</p>

            <p>To enter the stair, the User must wield a Key- and sight something that looks like a staircase, leap upon the stair and succeed on a DC 25 Charisma Save. To remain on the stair, the user must stay concentrated on their destination and can perform no action but to climb the stair. If a user has no destination in mind and they enter the stair they will be trapped on the first landing they find. On the way to their destination, the User will encounter 1d10 Landings. Upon arriving at a landing, the user must retake the stair within 1 minute, or remain trapped on the landing for 1d6 days. The key will function as normal, except to enter the stair. Upon entering a landing, the user must find something resembling a staircase and make the same DC 25 Charisma Save to re enter the stair. If the user stops at any point on the stair, they will be thrown onto a landing and trapped there for 1d6 days.</p>

            <p>If a person is bringing someone with them, they must make a strength Save of DC 15, +1 for every additional person after the first. Or you fail to enter the stair properly. You may immediately remake this Save, after succeeding on the Charisma Saving throw.</p>

            <p>If a person possessâ€™ more than 1 key, all rolls and Saves decrease by 1. If it is the 7th Key Charisma Saves become DC 20 and Landings become 1d6. Strength Save becomes DC 10. Stranded Saves become 1d4 Days.</p>

            <p>With every use of the WISH function of a KEY- roll 1d20. If it is a 1, the User and everyone affected by the Wish spell is thrown onto the stair and remains stuck on the first landing found.</p>
