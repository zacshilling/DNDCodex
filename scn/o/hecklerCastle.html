            <p>Castle Heckler is a place of great evil.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>Founded and constructed by the Ensares family, a cruel and rich family that had huge amounts of power over the land but slipped into complacency in their later years. Subsequently, their butler Lionel Heckler, killed them all in their sleep and claimed the castle for his own family. Heckler got away cleanly with the murders except for the daughter Madina who tried to flee but ran headfirst into a tainted magic mirror and broke it, tying her soul to the mirror.</p>

            <p>The Ghost of Madina, now able to move from mirror to mirror at will, but unable to exist outside one for very long haunts the new occupants of the Castle, the Heckler Family. The Heckler Family, originally prominent members of the Lord's Alliance, were gradually corrupted by the vengeful spirit of Madina and steadily degraded into fanatic worship of the Faceless One's. With the discreditation of the Heckler family name complet,e the spirit of Madina was finally put to rest.</p>

            <p>Eventually, after accruing many magical artifacts and servants the Hecklers were eventually driven from the Castle by an Ancient White Dragon, that despite its incredable power and wealth, was nearing the end of it's lifespan. Along with the Dragon which now occupied Castle Heckler, a cult of dragon worshipers moved into the tunnels beneath the castle and conduced their rituals from it.</p>
