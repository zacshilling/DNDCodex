                <li><strong>Stonehill Inn</strong> - A modest inn that was run by a short, friendly young human male named <a href="#tstonehill">Toblen Stonehill.</a> Toblen came from the east of the Triboar, seeking the opportunity in prospecting like many others. He soon found that he knew more about running an inn than mining, and so he established the inn. Many years later, an adventurer named Tyrese purchased a shares in the Inn, receiving a 10% share of all net profits. The adventurer never returned to Phandalin though and the money owed to him is kept in a trust fund at the Townmasterâ€™s Hall.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Barthen's Provisions</strong> - The biggest trading post in Phandalin, that stayed open from sunup to sundown. It was run by a lean and balding human male of fifty years with a kindly manner named Elmar Barthen.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Edermath Orchard</strong> - A orchard field with a simple cottage of a silver-haired half-elf named Daren Edermath. Daren was a retired marshal in the lands of the Dragon Coast. When he retired, he returned to the Neverwinter region which was his orginal home.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Phandalin Miner's Exchange</strong> - A trading post where miners have their finds weighed and paid out. The townsmaster's records were kept here in response of no local lord. The exchange was run by an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. As a part of the Zhentarim, Halia attempted to slowly take control of Phandalin since the town had no official lord</li><br>

                <li><strong>The Sleeping Giant</strong> - A rundown, dirty, and dangerous watering hole. It was known for being frequented by the RedBrand bandits before they were wiped out by a group of travelling adventurers. It is operated by a surly female dwarf named Grista.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Townmaster's Hall</strong> - A small building that worked as the town's council building. It also housed a small, but serviceable jail in the cellar. It was run by the townsmaster, Harbin Wester.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Tresendar Manor</strong> - More of a castle than a manor, it was an ancient building that was abandoned after the orc raids in 951 DR. The cellars have been turned into the hideout of the Redbrands. The cellars were once served as a safe haven when the estate was attacked. It also served as a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar Family. Later, a band of adventures (Tempest, Tyrese, Tyrone and Vynce) raided the hideout, killing almost all the bandits and their leader.</li><br>
