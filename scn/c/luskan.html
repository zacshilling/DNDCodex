            <button>Back to Sword Coast North</button></a>

            <p>Luskan is a pirate city, one of the two great priate cities of Faerun, the other being Hush-grah in the Pirate Isles. While Hush-grah is protected from those who would do her harm by geographical isolation, Luskan is a city fortress, able to withstand blockade almost indefinitely and has for almost 200 years now. The Lord’s Alliance has a garrison stationed just outside Luskan, preventing anyone and anything from entering or exiting via land, fortunately for the pirates, it is neigh impossible to prevent pirates from leaving via sea, for every time a navy has tried, it’s been defeated easily by the pirate fleet.</p>

            <h3>Government</h3>

            <p>Government is a term that anyone with any sense would use only very loosely when talking about the council of Luskan. The council’s only function is to maintain the <a href="#pcodex">Pirate Codex,</a> which is obeyed by every pirate that flies the Luskan flag. The codex is maintained by a ship’s captain and his word is law over his crew and very few men are willing to sail with a captain that doesn't follow the codex. If there is a dispute between two or members of different crews, the captains of said crews must take the argument before the council. Punishments are decided entirely arbitrarily.</p>

            <h4><a id="pcodex">The Pirate Codex</a></h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Captain decides how and where loot is sold or traded. After the sale of said plunder, any ships expenses, if the ships kitty is empty (rations, repairs, refit, supplies etc) are first taken out of the loot. Any remaining loot is split according to the following stipulations:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ship’s kitty then receives two full shares  (for resupply, supplies, etc)</li>
                    <li>Captain receives two shares</li>
                    <li>Mate receives one and a half shares</li>
                    <li>Ships Doctor, Cook, Quartermaster, Smithy or other special position, if they be onboard receive one and a quarter share.</li>
                    <li>The rest of the crew receives one share</li>
                    <li>Passengers, if there be any and if they take place in any skirmishes or assist with sailing in any significant way receive one half share.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The right to Parlay</li>
                <li>Any man that falls behind, is left behind, unless they were at the time undertaking some mission that would have especially aided the ship, should be left behind.</li>
                <li>Attacking a fellow Pirates ship is strictly forbidden</li>
                <li>Any enemy that surrenders must be taken prisoner set and set free at the earliest opportunity</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Council Members</h4>

            <p>Council Members are elected by the council, but only Captains are eligible. There are 8 council members so that when one dies, the vote cannot be split. (The system does not account for what happens if more than one pirate dies at once, as it has never happened before.)</p>
